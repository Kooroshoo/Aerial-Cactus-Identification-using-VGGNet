# Aerial-Cactus-Identification-using-VGGNet
In this project we created an algorithm that can identify specific type of cactus in aerial imagery. So basically classifying cactus and non cactus images using VGGNet-16 architecture.

The Dataset
- Gotten from Kaggle
- Resolution of 32 x 32 images of cactus plant for classification.
- The code is written in Python and we used Keras as our framewok.
